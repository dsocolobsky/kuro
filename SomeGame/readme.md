# Kuro

Kuro is a little game engine I'm building on top of SFML, with the objective of simplifying
the development of 2D games. It uses C++11/14 heavily and is inspired by the Entity-Component
system.

Note that I'm not an expert developer by any means, and this is just a hobby project.
Currently this repository includes not only the engine but also a small game I'm building,
I will separate both projects once I deem neccessary.

## TO-DO
[] Create a proper library, separate projects

### Components
[] Create a TextureComponent
#### PhysicsComponent
[] Add support for gravity
[] Add support for drag
[] Work on collisions

### World
[] Add Tiled loader
